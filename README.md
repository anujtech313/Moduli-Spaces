# Exploring Moduli Spaces: \( \mathcal{M}_1 \) to \( \mathcal{M}_{23} \)

This repository hosts a detailed exploration of moduli spaces of algebraic curves, focusing on their mathematical structure, significance, and properties. The project spans from foundational moduli spaces like \( \mathcal{M}_1 \) (elliptic curves) to the advanced and intricate \( \mathcal{M}_{23} \), shedding light on their role in algebraic geometry.


## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

### What Are Moduli Spaces?
Moduli spaces provide a framework for classifying algebraic curves based on specific properties like genus. Think of them as "maps" that organize all possible curves of a certain type.

### Highlights of the Project:
1. **Introduction to Moduli Spaces**: Explains their mathematical foundation and real-world analogies.
2. **Properties of \( \mathcal{M}_g \)**: Analyzes spaces for genera \( g = 1, 2, 3, \dots, 23 \), with detailed insights into their properties.
3. **Focus on \( \mathcal{M}_{23} \)**: Discusses the challenges and discoveries related to this complex space, inspired by Gavril Farkas' research.
4. **Analogies and Examples**: Provides simplified explanations and analogies for better understanding.
